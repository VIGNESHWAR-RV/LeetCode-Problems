   APPROACH 1 ( not working if there are multiple same characters )

   looping through the string t once, 
   we can find the characters present in string s
   then joining those found characters 
   if string of found characters is exactly equal to the string s
      return true; 
   else
      return false;


    APPROACH 2 ( working )

    looping through the string t once, 
    having a counter with 0 to start from s[counter]  i.e s[0] 
    incrementing counter with 1 on each matching character with s[counter] during loop i.e s[1], s[2]
    finally checking the counter with s.length 
      if equal 
         return true; 
      else 
         return false;

    var isSubsequence = function(s, t) {
       const sLength = s.length; 
       const tLength = t.length;
     
       let sCount = 0; 

       for( let i=0; i < tLength; i++) {
           if (t[i] === s[sCount]) {
               sCount += 1;
           }
       }

       return (sCount === sLength) ? true : false

    };

let s = "abc";
let t = "adbxc";
console.log(isSubsequence(s,t));
